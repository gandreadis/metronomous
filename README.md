# metronomous
A metronome for musicians who want to practice speeding things up

## What is it?
A simple web app meant to be used as a practice metronome.

## Why another metronome?
This one can speed up the tempo gradually. So whenever you come across a difficult piece, try first taking it slow and gradually speeding up. Give metronomous the starting and goal tempo, as well as the step interval and the amount of time you have. metronomous will automagically speed up the tempo!

This way, you build up a solid technical skill of the piece you need to get just right, instead of rushing things through and calling it done.
