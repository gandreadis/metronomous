# metronomous
A metronome for musicians who want to practice speeding things up

## What is it?
A simple web app meant to be used as a practice metronome.

## Why another metronome?
This one can speed up. So whenever you come across a different piece, try first taking it slow and gradually speeding up. Give metronomous the starting and goal tempo, as well as the step interval and the amount of time you have. metronomous will automagically speed up the tempo!
